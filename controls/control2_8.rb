  title 'Enable user namespace support'
  desc 'Enable user namespace support in Docker daemon to utilize container user to host user re-mapping. This recommendation is beneficial where containers you are using do not have an explicit container user defined in the container image. If container images that you are using have a pre-defined non-root user, this recommendation may be skipped since this feature is still in its infancy and might give you unpredictable issues and complexities.'
